# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques on a Kaggle competition.

## Overview
- Built an end-to-end regression pipeline for house price prediction
- Performed data preprocessing and feature handling
- Trained and evaluated a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated performance using RMSE
- Generated predictions in Kaggle submission format

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from a **Kaggle competition**.

⚠️ **Note:**  
The original `train.csv` and `test.csv` files are **not included in this repository** due to dataset size and licensing constraints.

To reproduce this project:
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle
2. Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the project root directory
3. Run the notebook

## Files in this Repository
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- `submission.csv` – Predicted house prices generated by the Linear Regression model
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Model
- Algorithm: **Linear Regression**
- Evaluation Metric: **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

## Results
The model achieved a reasonable RMSE, indicating good performance for predicting house prices on unseen data.

## Notes
The original Kaggle competition is now **closed**, so leaderboard submission is no longer possible.  
This repository is maintained for **learning, portfolio, and demonstration purposes**.

## Author
Created as part of a machine learning learning journey using Kaggle datasets.
